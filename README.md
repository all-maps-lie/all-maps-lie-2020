# All Maps Lie: Introduction to Critical Mapping and Open Source Geospatial Web Analysis and Visualization
**NYU, Interactive Telecommunications Program, Spring 2020**

**work in progress - plz ignore**

## Course Description

*All Maps Lie: Introduction to Critical Mapping and Open Source Geospatial Web Analysis and Visualization* is an introduction to critical perspectives in cartography and geospatial information systems and web technologies. This course will introduce students to the foundations of geographic data analysis and visualization, grounding practical studio based exercises and projects with critical readings and theory. Students taking this course will gain an appreciation for geographic thinking, learn to ask geographic questions, and apply basic methodologies to ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù of geographic data. 

The course will be conducted with open source geographic information systems and web technologies. Students are not expected to enter the class with knowledge of these tools, but will be expected to learn and apply them through studio exercises and project briefings.

Topics To cover:

quotes:
- "close things are more related that far things" - tobler's first law of geography

# Topics:
- Introduction
  - geospatial data
- Scale
  - map scales

## Introduction: 

Geospatial Data
- what is/are data?
- where do data come from?
- what does it mean for data to be geographic?
- where are data stored
- what are geographic data formats?
- what are geographic data types?
- how do geospatial data affect/effect your data life?
- what are ways that geospatial data and computation come together?
  - routing
  - wayfinding
  - spatial analysis, geographic distributions
  - prediction/forecasting

Geographic data dimensionality and characteristics:
- data dimensions:
  - points
  - lines
  - polygons
  - surfaces
- data types:
  - nominal: name
  - ordinal: comparable by rank, orderable
  - interval: scale has no absolute "0", but can be compared to one another. e.g. you can say 5degC is 15degC less than 20degC but you cant say  that it is 3times less
  - ratio: scale has an absolute "0", e.g. money. 
  - scalar: you create your own scale that applies specifically to that data e.g. readability on a scale of 1 to 10

Spatial Considerations: All consider location, patterns, and distributions
- density
- sinuosity
- connectivity
- pattern change
- movement
- shape
- size
- isolation
- adjacency

Examples of GIS/Geospatial data analysis and computation in the wild:
- business cases
- physical science research
- social science research
- art


## Scale

Map scales
- determines how much or how little your map can hold
- See chart of map scales of USGS 
- Scale and representation
- Generalizations:
  - scale, readability, crowding
  - data availablity
  - limitations of output devices or media, e.g. print, vs. web
  - reader characteristics
- large scale == "more details, smaller area"
- small scale == "less details, larger area covered"

Different types of maps
- reference: only offer the pattern and general locations of things
- thematic: provides as much detail about a specific subject


Map projections and datums
- converting a sphere into a flat map results in distortion!
- picking the right projection
- In general, 3 families:
  - planer, conic, cylindrical
- Preserving:
  - distance
  - area
  - direction
- Projection and reprojection: rounds off tiny numbers and makes erros in position! 
- Good projections depend on accurate datum
- Geodesy is the science of accurately measuring the spherical earth
- Datum: is a model of the earth's shape that allows geodetic sceintists and surveyors to accurately measure the Earth and place the origins and orientation of the coordinate systems
  - datums depend on ellipsoids -- which are different methods and models of the earth
- Why does all this matter? GIS software needs to know what datum you're using for each set of map data you put into your database - attaching coordinates to the wrong datum can result in location and measurement errors ==> a common task in GIS is to make sure all your geo data are in the same datum before proceeding.
- Coordinate Systems and land subdivisions
  - UTM: Universal Transverse Mercator 
    - why? 
    - 1. you can measure the stuff in positive numbers from east and north regardless of what hemispehere you're in
    - 2. you never have to use negative numbers
    - uses eastings and northings
    - accuracy up to 1-meter resolution (5 digit accuracy) 
  - In the US we have a system called PLSS - public land survey system based on the Acre 1/640 of a square mile

## Reading, analyzing, and interpreting maps

- points, lines, polygons, and volumes
- Recoginizing patterns
  - Randomness
  - Clustering
  - Uniformity
- Describing patterns
  - Describing linear features
    - dendritic
    - radial
    - centripetal
    - parallel
    - trellis
    - rectangular
    - annular
  - Analyzing and quantifying patterns
    - Nearest Neighbor Statistic - determine whether a pattern of points is regular, random, or clustered. See book for nearest neighbor algorithm


Maps as questions and answers
- maps as media prompt further questions

### STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

Plagiarism is presenting someone else‚Äôs work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer‚Äôs work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

### STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLE

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice.  Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.

Please let your instructor know if you need help connecting to these resources.

### STATEMENT ON USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES

Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lecture. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations.  Phone use in class is strictly prohibited unless directly related to a presentation of your own work or if you are asked to do so as part of the curriculum.
