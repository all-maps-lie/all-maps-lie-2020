## COURSE DESCRIPTION

*All Maps Lie* is an introduction to critical cartography and mapping from the perspective of media art and design. In this course, we will reflect on and respond to different "geographic prompts" that allow us to discuss the history, theory, and practice of mapping. By engaging in "mapping" and the various methods of "making sense of geography" we will develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for critical geographic histories and politics and the "situatedness" of knowledge and power. Students will be challenged to articulate the value, limitations, and possibilities for media arts practice to contribute to the critical cartographic discourse through their projects.

Students taking this course can expect to gain an appreciation for geographic thinking, learn to ask critical and geographic questions, and apply basic methodologies to ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù of geographic data.

The course will be conducted with open source tools and technologies. Students are not expected to enter the class with knowledge of these tools, but will be expected to learn and apply them through studio exercises and project briefings.

## IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE LAND

Each day at ITP and every session of this course, we are gathered on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded Indigenous land of the Lenape and Canarsie peoples. I ask you to join me in acknowledging the Lenape and Canarsie communities, their elders both past and present, and their future generations. I acknowledge that whether intentionally or through ignorance, NYU and ITP was founded upon exclusions and erasures of many Indigenous peoples, including those on whose land this institution is located.

This acknowledgement demonstrates a commitment to reckoning with the history of the land upon which we are gathered and beginning the process of working to dismantle the ongoing legacies of settler colonialism. 

We start this process through building our own awareness and appreciation for the land we are able to live, work, and play on and integrating these awarenesses into the art we make, the tools we build, and the work we do.

## OBJECTIVES

* *To practice paying attention*:
  * The class will be grounded in developing strategies to "pay attention." Through your sustained mapping and data collection efforts as part of this course, you will tune into the frequency of the world and learn to focus in on the details that might be otherwise overlooked or intentionally suppressed, repressed or erased. You will ultimately learn how "paying attention" is a crucial skill for critical engagement with mapping and media art/design practice more broadly.

* *To ask geographic questions*:
  * You will learn that everything is spatial and that geography matters. To ask geographic questions means you will not only be asking questions about **space** (physical, topographic, infrastructural) and **place** (cultural, affective, emotional) but also history and power and how geography is shaped by and and comes to shape power. 
* *To explore spatial media*:
  * This course is structured around "making/doing/mapping" as an approach to working through key concepts related to critical cartography and the topic of critique more broadly. By creating work that explores spatial media -- media/technology/data about geography -- we humbly acknowledge that our media art and design approaches to mapping are valuable, limited, and affective all at the same time. We therefore attempt to make contributions to the discourse of mapping and geography as "outsiders" or, rather non-domain experts.
* *To learn together*:
  * This is a course about learning together. You will be confronted by challenging concepts, technical road bumps, and the winter cold. A core outcome of this class is to share your learning and discoveries and research with each other.

## Evaluation & Grading

Students will be evaluated on effort, personal progress and growth, class participation, assignments, and the final project. It is understood that this course will be technically and conceptually challenging, therefore your effort, curiosity, and engagement is of utmost importance. You will be graded on your progress throughout the class, your ability to complete assignments on time, your interaction with peers, and your ability to justify your decisions thoughtfully.

Notes can be found at this url on [How to give Feedback](https://github.com/itp-dwd/2020-spring/wiki/How-to:-Feedback) 

### GRADE CALCULATION:

Here is a basic breakdown of graded tasks along that trajectory:
* 10% Attendance/Participation
* 50% Assignments
* 10% Project Proposal
* 30% Final Project, completed on conclusion of the course
* TOTAL: 100%

Here's an outline of how your work will generally be evaluated. The explaners of each category are rough guidelines for how I assign numbers (or quantify üòâ) to the work you are producing in this class. Inspired by [cmda-tt course](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-17-18/tree/master/assessment-3).

| Category | 1 - 2 pts | 3 - 4 pts | 5 - 6 pts | 7 - 8 pts | 9 - 10 pts |
| :------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **Quality**  | The work is handed in late, broken, incomplete, undocumented, or shows lack of care or thought | The work is only partially documented and seems only partially complete | The work is documented and represents the student's concept and shows good effort | The work is well documented, thoughtful, and professional | The work shows mastery and is well polished |
| **Understanding** | There is either no substance or the student cannot explain or justify decision making | The work shows partial grasp of the concepts, but shows major gaps that could be addressed with more thought | The work is sensible and grounded and can be explained in a coherent manner | The work represents the concept well, references past and current work. The student can speak to more than 1 perspective. | The work shows strong graps of concepts and the state-of-the-art. The work is well received in both concept and implementation |
| **Application** | The work reflects very little conceptual references to the course materials; a general lack of awareness to methodology and implementation | The work applies methodology(ies) that have some potential, but not quite relevant or effective | The work uses methods that are appropriate and thoughtful. The application of methods are standard and show good potential | The work uses methods that are appropriate, thoughtful, and well implemented. There are innovative ideas that are shown in the application. | There work shows careful methodological considerations and is beautifully crafted, designed, and presented. |

### LATE ASSIGNMENTS:

The general policy is that **late assignments will not be reviewed**. 

As such, here are my general suggestions for working on projects and assignments (in this class and beyond):

- 1. **Always have something to show**: While developing your projects, always have a "minimum reviewable unit" that speaks to your project concept. Even if your project doesn't technically "work", you should always have something to present.
- 2. **Submit on time and refine**: Submit what you have on time. If you followed suggestion #1 above, then you'll have material to discuss and explain where you're at and where you're trying to go. You can always refine and update what you have even after the deadline, but if you have nothing to show, then your effort cannot be evaluated and improved.
