# All Maps Lie: Introduction to Critical Mapping and Open Source Geospatial Web Analysis and Visualization
**NYU, Interactive Telecommunications Program, Spring 2020**

**work in progress - plz ignore**

## Course Description

*All Maps Lie: Introduction to Critical Mapping and Open Source Geospatial Web Analysis and Visualization* is an introduction to critical perspectives in cartography and geospatial information systems and web technologies. This course will introduce students to the foundations of geographic data analysis and visualization, grounding practical studio based exercises and projects with critical readings and theory. Students taking this course will gain an appreciation for geographic thinking, learn to ask geographic questions, and apply basic methodologies to ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù of geographic data. 

The course will be conducted with open source geographic information systems and web technologies. Students are not expected to enter the class with knowledge of these tools, but will be expected to learn and apply them through studio exercises and project briefings.

## Evaluation & Grading

Students will be evaluated on effort, personal progress and growth, class participation, assignments, and the final project. It is understood that this course will be technically and conceptually challenging, therefore your effort, curiosity, and engagement is of utmost importance. You will be graded on your progress throughout the class, your ability to complete assignments on time, your interaction with peers, and your ability to justify your decisions thoughtfully.

**GRADE CALCULATION**:

Here is a basic breakdown of graded tasks along that trajectory:
* 10% Attendance/Participation
* 50% Assignments
* 10% Project Proposal
* 30% Final Project, completed on conclusion of the course
* TOTAL: 100%

Here's an outline of how your work will generally be evaluated. The explaners of each category are rough guidelines for how I assign numbers (or quantify üòâ) to the work you are producing in this class. Inspired by [cmda-tt course](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-17-18/tree/master/assessment-3).

| Category | 1 - 2 pts | 3 - 4 pts | 5 - 6 pts | 7 - 8 pts | 9 - 10 pts |
| :------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **Quality**  | The work is handed in late, broken, incomplete, undocumented, or shows lack of care or thought | The work is only partially documented and seems only partially complete | The work is documented and represents the student's concept and shows good effort | The work is well documented, thoughtful, and professional | The work shows mastery and is well polished |
| **Understanding** | There is either no substance or the student cannot explain or justify decision making | The work shows partial grasp of the concepts, but shows major gaps that could be addressed with more thought | The work is sensible and grounded and can be explained in a coherent manner | The work represents the concept well, references past and current work. The student can speak to more than 1 perspective. | The work shows strong graps of concepts and the state-of-the-art. The work is well received in both concept and implementation |
| **Application** | The work reflects very little conceptual references to the course materials; a general lack of awareness to methodology and implementation | The work applies methodology(ies) that have some potential, but not quite relevant or effective | The work uses methods that are appropriate and thoughtful. The application of methods are standard and show good potential | The work uses methods that are appropriate, thoughtful, and well implemented. There are innovative ideas that are shown in the application. | There work shows careful methodological considerations and is beautifully crafted, designed, and presented. |

**LATE ASSIGNMENTS**:

The general policy is that **late assignments will not be reviewed**. 

As such, here are my general suggestions for working on projects and assignments (in this class and beyond):

- 1. **Always have something to show**: While developing your projects, always have a "minimum reviewable unit" that speaks to your project concept. Even if your project doesn't technically "work", you should always have something to present.
- 2. **Submit on time and refine**: Submit what you have on time. If you followed suggestion #1 above, then you'll have material to discuss and explain where you're at and where you're trying to go. You can always refine and update what you have even after the deadline, but if you have nothing to show, then your effort cannot be evaluated and improved.


<!-- The easiest thing to do is to just turn thing in on time. You get closure, I can give you careful and constructive feedback, and everyone grows. In the case you can't get you assignment in on time here is the deal:

- 1. email me informing me why your assignment is not submitted on time ‚Üí 
- 2. submit documentation of what you've worked on so far, what went wrong, and what you plan to do ‚Üí
- 3. late assignments will be marked down half a letter grade (or commensurate points given the scale above) until the assignment receives a C (or equivalent). Do not expect the same quality or timeliness of feedback for late assignments.  -->
