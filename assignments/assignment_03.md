# A3: Spatial Abstraction

## Brief

This week your assignment is to explore different geo-spatial data processing methods using [turf.js](https://turfjs.org/) to:
1. Create different data derivatives and spatial abstractions from your point data
2. Visualize your spatial abstractions.

## Readings

* See [Week 3 Readings](../BIBLIOGRAPHY.md#week-03-maps-as-media)

## Technical References

* [Geosandbox - Turf.js](https://joeyklee.github.io/geosandbox/hello-turf.html)

## Requirements

### Part 1: Spatial Abstractions

* Create the following geojson data abstractions from your point data:
  * [Buffer]() and ...
    * [Intersect]()
    * [Union]()
  * Grids:
    * [Square Grid]()
      * 50m
      * 100m
      * 250m
    * [Hexagonal Grid]()
      * 50m
      * 100m
      * 250m
    * [Triangular Grid]() - Optional
  * Density:
    * [Isolines/Contour lines]()
    * [Triangular Irregular Network]()
    * [Voronoi]()
  * View direction:
    * [Field of View - Turf/Sector](https://turfjs.org/docs/#sector)
  * Clustering:
    * [kMeans]()
  * Overview:
    * [Convex]()
    * [Concave]()
    * [Bezier Spline]()

### Part 2: Visualization

Visualize the data abstractions on the map. Style the visual properties appropriately. 

You may consider importing your geojson data into [Kepler.gl]() to explore the data using the GUI rather than through code. 

### Part 3: Documentation & Organization

Document your process, you understanding or questions about the code, and begin remarking on any patterns you might see when viewing your data on the map. Document this on your blog.

* Key questions:
  * What stories do these different spatial abstractions and data derivatives tell? 
  * ...
  * ...
