# A1: Paying Attention

## Brief:

This week your assignment is to begin observing the environment using your location-enabled cameraphone. Your task will be to **define ONE subject/phenomenon of interest** and catalog it with photographs, the accompanying geo-metadata that is created with that image, and any additional observational annotations. This practice will continue throughout the duration of the course; the data you collect will be central to grounding the theoretical and practical aspects of this course. 

The point of this observational experiment is to train you to focus your attention. Throughout the course, you will be challenged to simultaneously observe and unpack your subject's varying characteristics and qualities and, more interestingly, the subject's history, politics, and geography.

This week, your task is to choose one subject/phenomenon of interest and be meticulous about collecting photographic evidence of it. There are key constraints to the subject you select, listed below:
* You **may not**:
  * violate the privacy of another person - surveilling without permission is not permitted.
  * choose a subject that will put yourself or another person in danger.
  * do anything illegal 
* You **may**:
  * select a seemingly "simple" subject (simple topics will inevitably lead to complexity, no doubt!)
  * "observe" from afar - if you are particularly passionate about "remote sensing" or remote data collection - your data collection/"paying attention" may take the form of collecting imagery of a specific subject using the web or other platforms.

On a meta level: you will have 5 assignments in total with the final project being a synthesis and documentation of all of those 5 projects. This is just to say that each of your assignments is one component of the final work in this class and therefore will each be part of a coherent narrative.

## Readings

* See: [Week 1 - Readings](../BIBLIOGRAPHY.md#week-01-everything-is-spatial)

## Requirements

### Part 1: Selecting a Subject

Choose a subject to observe. 

Methodological considerations:
* [Paying attention guide](../guides/paying-attention-guide.md)

Some recommendations:
* Empty tree beds (Joey will be doing this!)
* Stolen bikes or evidence of stolen bikes
* Broken sidewalk infrastructure

### Part 2: Begin - Observation

Define a method - rules for observation - for how you will photograph your subject of interest. 

Methodological considerations:
* [Cameraphone guide](../guides/camera-phone-guide.md)


### Part 3: Documentation & Organization

Create a project folder and set it up such that you can keep your data and observations tidy. Document your images in a blog. Add any relevant annotations and notes, reflections, and questions that might be starting to arise about the subject, the methodologies, and anything else that comes to mind.

Additional Methodological considerations:
* [Googleform guide](../guids/../guides/google-form-guide.md)

### Part 4: Create a spatial dataset of your points

Create a spatial dataset, specifically a `geojson` file from your images. Open that geojson file in [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/), a web service that allows you to easily view and make geospatial data, to visualize your data.

* **Automated** process: Ideally you can automate this process by using [img2meta](https://github.com/joeyklee/img2meta) to create a `.geojson` dataset from a folder of images (use the `true` flag). With the `img_metadata.geojson` you can drag-and-drop it into [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/).
* **Manual** process: Otherwise, there are analog methods for retrieving the metadata from your images as seen in [How to See an Imageâ€™s EXIF Data in Windows and macOS, How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/289712/how-to-see-an-images-exif-data-in-windows-and-macos/) in which you can create a `.csv` file or spreadsheet where you can manually create your data. Notes on structuring your spreadsheet data as a CSV and converting it to geojson can be found in the [CSV to GeoJSON Guide](../guides/csv-to-geojson-guide.md).
