## READINGS

## BRIEF

This week, your assignment is comprised of 3 main activities:
1. Final Project Proposal Brainstorming
2. Data Scavenger Hunt
3. Documentation

The 3 activities are outlined in further detail below.

## REQUIREMENTS

### Part 1: Final Project Proposal Brainstorming & Moodboard

As part of the [final project](assignments/final-project.md) in this course, you will be required to submit a [final project proposal](assignments/final-project.md#part-1-written-proposal). Please see the requirements there. You will have 2 weeks to complete the final project proposal, however, you will **begin the process of brainstorming, researching, and articulating your ideas now**. 

As written in the proposal outline, you will need to include:

1. a topic description, thematic overview, problem statement, or research question; 
2. a discussion of your topic‚Äôs personal relevance, larger critical or political significance, timeliness, etc.; 
3. a preliminary discussion of how your topic might lend itself to spatial/cartographic investigation (i.e., **what can you learn by mapping it**?);
4. a description of the geographic area(s) and scale(s) you plan to focus on in your maps; and 
5. a tentative bibliography of **at least seven sources** (some scholarly publications, some popular publications, some precedent maps, etc.) that will likely prove useful in your research and practice. 

To start, you should begin collecting references, inspirations, and begin a moodboard that helps you to articulate anything about the style, types of outcomes, feelings, moods, genres, and domain focuses that may resonate with you and your final project interests.

### Part 2: Data Scavenger Hunt

There is a general rule in the data world that which is that 80% of your time will be spent on collecting, cleaning, and learning about your data. The rest of the 20% is then spent on the thing you actually wanted to do with that data in the first place. 

For this week's assignment, you will begin what I've called a Data Scavenger hunt. This will be comprised of data collection in two forms:

1. **Streetview Mapper**: You will create and account with the [Streetview Mapper](https://streetview-mapper.org/) - a tool that allows you to map locations and collect streetview snapshots from the Google Streetview service - and explore data collection through this interface. You are asked to contribute at least **10 items** to the Streetview Mapper database. Instructions on how sign up and what purpose the Streetview Mapper can be read on the projects [Streetview Mapper Documentation website](https://learn.streetview-mapper.org). Take screenshots of the items you've decided to contribute and share them in your blog post outlined below.
2. **Data Scavenging** You will begin "scavenging" for - collecting links or downloading - data that may be relevant for your final projects. You will document where your data comes from, when the data were created, who the authors of those data are, any limitations that you're aware of, questions you have about the data, and how it may be relevant to helping you to develop your final project. 


### Part 3: Documentation

You will write and submit a blog post that documents what you've done in Parts 1 and 2 of this assignment: 
1. Part 1: Final Project Proposal Brainstorming & Moodboard 
2. Part 2: Data Scavenger Hunt

You will submit a blog post with links, references, screenshots, and reflections. 

Some reflection questions that you might address are:
1. What aspect of mapping is most intriguing to you?
2. What are blank spots in your knowledge you'd like to address in this class?
3. What does critical mapping mean to you? 
4. How have maps shaped your world view?
5. Can you recall any instances in which maps have deceived you in some way? Can you recall any instances in which maps have enriched your life in some way?
6. If someone says, "maps cause wars" - how would you respond?


## SUBMISSION

You will submit a link to your blog post to the link below, specifying which assignment you are submitting:
