# A4: Locative Media (recommended, but optional)

## Brief

Create an experience that orients you.

This week your assignment is to create a locative media experience using the data you have been collecting or researching about. The question that Locative Media engages with is summed up in Crampton's provocation: "If you break from cartesian space what new perspectives will be thrown up?" Taking this as a prompt, how might you engage with directionality, location, and orientation using new media like web maps and/or smart phones?

Some prompts that you may draw from:
* Build a "compass" that guides and directs you to the physical locations of your data.
* Create a walking tour that highlights aspects of your data.
* Create an ephemeral sculpture (e.g. with long-exposure photography, see note on chalk or tape below).
* Use your geolocation to prevent an event from occurring in promity to a data point.
* Use your geolocation to trigger an event in proximity to a data point.

NOTE: Be careful for ways in which your interventions might be classified as graffiti or defacement of property - [Chalk a Sidewalk, Go to Jail, MotherJones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/08/war-chalk-arrests/).

You are encouraged to document how you or others are meant to experience your piece. **The documentation (images and/or video) is the output** in this assignment. Emphasis should be given to communicating the concept of your locative media experience and not just be a technical implementation or prototype.

Note that in order to see anything changing, you'll either have to run these on mobile or change the device orientation using the browser's dev tools (e.g. [Override geolocation in Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/geolocation) or [Simulate device orientaiton](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/orientation) )

### Part 3: Documentation & Organization

Prototype and develop your concept. Document with photos and video how your locative media work is experienced. Add your video to [Vimeo](vimeo.com/) or [Youtube](youtube.com/) or some other media streaming service that can be shareable with your classmates and/or the general public.

Document your process, the results of your locative media experience, and blog about your concept and implementation.
