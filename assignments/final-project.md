# COURSE PROJECT

At the beginning of the semester you should begin to think about a fluid, capacious **research topic that you’d like to explore through the maps you create over the course of the semester**. Ideally, this topic will pertain to projects you’re exploring in your other classes or your thesis, to a “through-line” you’ve pursued throughout your academic program, or to work you’re doing in your extracurricular life. 


# DEADLINES

| Item | Week | Deadline |
| :----    | ---- | ---- | 
| Written Proposal | Week 3 |  April 13 |
| Quick & Dirty Proposal Presentation | Week 3 |  April 13 |
| 1-on-1 Check-ins | Week 2 - Week 6 |  N/A |
| Final Project Presentation | Week 7 |  April 6 |


## PROPOSAL

### PART 1: WRITTEN PROPOSAL

You’ll need to submit a 600-word (max., or otherwise substantial) proposal for this project, via the [Google Forms Submission Form](). 

This proposal should include:

1. a topic description, thematic overview, problem statement, or research question; 
2. a discussion of your topic’s personal relevance, larger critical or political significance, timeliness, etc.; 
3. a preliminary discussion of how your topic might lend itself to spatial/cartographic investigation (i.e., **what can you learn by mapping it**?);
4. a description of the geographic area(s) and scale(s) you plan to focus on in your maps; and 
5. a tentative bibliography of **at least seven sources** (some scholarly publications, some popular publications, some precedent maps, etc.) that will likely prove useful in your research and practice. 


### PART 2: VIDEO PROPOSAL PRESENTATION

You’ll share your proposal in class as a 2-min (maxiumum) long video that coherently explains what you have proposed in your written proposal, highlighting proofs of concept, sketches, prototypes, and any materials that support your proposal. You will upload these materials to GDrive or Youtube to share during Week 3's class.

### PROGRESS

You will be expected to meet with your instructor *at least* twice  throughout the semester for progress updates. 

**Required:**
* Progress updates will take the form of 15 min meetings every other week based on which Block you are in. Please see the [Weekly Schedule](https://all-maps-lie-2020.netlify.com/#/README?id=weekly-schedule) to determine which week you are required to check-in.

**Optional:**
* You are encouraged to schedule time to chat outside of the required times for a 15-min check-in.

## OUTCOMES & EXPECTATIONS

Each of the maps you then create over the course of the semester should pertain to this topic and cumulatively represent myriad ways of illustrating or investigating your subject. You’ll begin exploring a few mapping strategies in/for our in-class labs. You can then continue to develop these prototypes independently, or generate map ideas of your own.

By the end of the semester, **you should have a minimum of four to five completed maps, in a variety of “media formats” (e.g., hand-drawn, photographic, audio-based, online-interactive, etc.)**. You’ll then need to compile those maps into an atlas, which you can present in whatever format you choose (e.g., a book, a website, an installation, etc.), as long as you frame the contents as a cartographic set –as five “spatial variations on a theme.” 

You should make sure to:
* offer some means of narratively or argumentatively navigating through your collection;
* generate connective threads between your individual maps; and 
* provide critical/descriptive commentary reflecting on the unique medial qualities of each piece in the set (see, for example, how Annette Kim, whom we’ll read later this semester,addresses the distinctive features of each map in her “Critical Cartography Primer,” on pp. 113-145 of Sidewalk City). 

As you peruse your atlas, ask yourself **Do my maps stand on their own?** **Do they speak for themselves?** Perhaps they don’t. Consider integrating prefaces, captions, legends, citations (i.e., where do the data come from?), disclaimers, etc., where appropriate. You’re also encouraged to integrate some of our class readings–or supplemental cartographic history and theory texts you’ve read on your own –into your atlas text(or, consider how Nick Sousanis graphically integrates theoretical material in his Unflattening). 

## SUBMISSION

Please do not email me five separate files or five separate links, or hand me five separate documents; **your final submission should be one integrated collection, with all components synthesized and contextualized.** If your work consists of analog, performative, or ephemeral media that doesn’t readily lend itself to submission, you’ll need to share with me some coherent form of documentation. 

You’ll submit your project **before the start of the final class in week 7**, and during that class each student will deliver a video presentation/documentation of their work (details to come). 



## FAQ

### What makes a successful project?

A successful project will:
1. **Showcase substantial effort and thoughtfulness in data collection and mapping**
   - **Quality**: Was your data collection done in a meticulous, rigorous, and/or careful manner? Was your data well organized? 
   - **Understanding**: Based on your collected data and documentation, was it clear that your mapping efforts were done thoughtfully. Your data collection should engage critical themes mentioned or discussed in the class such as those around ethics, privacy, social/environmental justice, feminism, power, race, etc. 
   - **Application**: More data is not necessarily better. What is important is that your collection is substantial and/or substantive to provide materials for discussion. Ultimately: were your collection methods appropriately applied?
2. **Educate your peers**
   - **Quality**: Did you make enough effort to synthesize and summarize your work such that others can engage with your focal point?
   - **Understanding**: Were you able to successfully synthesize and summarize your findings? 
   - **Application**: Were you able to create, collect, and make sense of materials - in the form of your projects and primary and secondary research - in coherent and appropriate manner? How well were you able to employ the [Implosion Methodology](https://journal.culanth.org/index.php/ca/article/view/ca29.2.09/301) to understand your subject.
3. **Surprise and delight**
   - **Quality**: Did you make an effort to prepare your materials in a manner that expresses care for how your peers and audience will experience your research?
   - **Understanding**: Did you engage with your focal point enough to arrive at potentially new perspectives? 
   - **Application**: Did you go beyond the given code examples? Did you inject your personality or style into the work in any way? 

These three criteria for evaluation should help inform you along the way. Please make sure to refer back to this through out the duration of the project.
