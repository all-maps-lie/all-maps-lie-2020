# Assignment 00: Course Project - *Mapping Urban Media*

Your final project for this course starts now, at week 1. Everything that you do in this course - every assignment and reading - will be in service of shaping a final, cohesive work. The course project for this 7-week semester is themed: *Mapping Urban Media*.

There will be a total of 5 assignments this semester that are designed to help you generate the touch points of your final work. Each of the assignments are designed to help you unpack what it means to be *mapping urban media*. 

You will use the assignments as prompts to support your [media archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_archaeology); you will attempt to understand and communicate about one super specific aspect of urban media. Through the process of simultaneously researching and creating work about the urban media of your choice, you will document and catalog your discoveries about *what you've come to know and understand about your urban phenomenon* and what social, cultural, political, and environmental processes and histories are/have been at play in shaping your urban media. 

The result of this exercise will be the production of a body of work that uses mapping and maps and to inform our understanding of geography and cartography. Upon the submission of your final work, your findings will be published as part of a class magazine.
