# Assignment 6: Final Project Documentation and Presentation

## Brief

Over the last 3 - 4 weeks, you've been exploring some geographic phenomenon. You've explored new tools, worked with open data, created your own spatial data sets, and even collected your own geographic data. In the process, you've refined your understanding of the advantages and disadvantages with working with maps and your own potential for shaping the world with maps. 

This week, it is time to wrap up your projects to be submitted and presented to the class in our final meeting.

<!-- Your final project began when this course started. 

Your task for this week is to collect, synthesize, reflect on, write about, and document all of your assignments in this class. 

You will be structuring your documentation in a highly structured manner so that your work can be synthesized as a "chapter" of the class zine which will contain your works and the work of your colleagues.  -->
