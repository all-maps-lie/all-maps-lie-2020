# A4: Locative Media

## Brief

This week your assignment is to create a locative media experience using the data you have been collecting. Your locative media piece **must interact with physical space** (or a reconstruction of physical space) in such a way that communicates some aspect of the data you've collected.

Some prompts that you may draw from:
* Build a "compass" that guides and directs you to the physical locations of your data.
* Create a walking tour that highlights aspects of your data.
* Create an ephemeral sculpture (e.g. with long-exposure photography, see note on chalk or tape below).
* Use your geolocation to prevent an event from occurring in promity to a data point.
* Use your geolocation to trigger an event in proximity to a data point.

NOTE: Be careful for ways in which your interventions might be classified as graffiti or defacement of property - [Chalk a Sidewalk, Go to Jail, MotherJones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/08/war-chalk-arrests/).

You must document how you or others are meant to experience your piece. **The documentation (images and/or video) is the output** in this assignment. Emphasis should be given to communicating the concept of your locative media experience and not just be a technical implementation or prototype.
