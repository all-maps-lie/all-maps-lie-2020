 # A4: Spatial Abstraction (recommended, but optional)


## Background 

Last week, you took some time to explore some different web mapping tools. You experienced that some tools made more sense to you than others or felt more appropriate at one part of the mapping process than another. The point of the exercise is that there's no one right tool, but rather an assemblage of tools that are more relevant than others depending on the context. The more time you spend mapping, you'll develop the ability to choose the right tools for your project needs. Like any creative work you do, it is natural to start with what makes sense/feels right to you and work towards developing new skills. [Lisa's post on how she feels when she learns to code is something you might relate to](https://lisacharlotterost.de/2016/09/29/learn-how-to-code/).

This week, we looked at a variety of mapping projects that explored how creative data processing pipelines could lead to intriguing geographic applications and spatial reimaginings. We will take this week to explore some of our own creative data processes/processings to continue our mapping practice.


## Brief

As you work towards your final projects, you're likely beginning to develop different methods of collecting, manipulating, and processing your data. All these steps hopefully bring you closer to making your ideas mo

This week your assignment is to explore different geo-spatial data processing methods and APIs that speak to some of the topics we discussed in class. 

As this is an optional, but recommended assignment, you're free to explore the directions that are most exciting to you. I have some prompts for suggestions, but ideally you can apply some of these provocations towards your final project ideas:
1. Create a map of all areas **outside** of your study using buffers
   * You can see in Chris Whong's [Subway Deserts](https://team.carto.com/u/chriswhong/viz/e60e7660-3982-11e5-9997-0e853d047bba/public_map) project that he applied buffers around subway stations to mask out all the areas that are realistically serviced by the subway leaving behind the areas that are not easily accessible by the subway.
2. Create a (simple) machine learning based image classification model to find unique land cover types:
   * You can try using the [Google Creative Lab's Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) to create your own custom image classifier. I've made a simple [LA Pool Classifier with Teachable Machine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vGNtn-RrO2lHkeomtxsdOFhpx-gi1yyV/view?usp=sharing).
3. Use a routing engine of your choice (e.g. Mapbox Directions API) to calculate the difference between manhattan distance and "as the crow flies" distance between places you know. 
   * You can use the distance generated by the routing engine (Manhattan distance) versus the distance calculated by something like [Turf.js - length function](http://turfjs.org/docs/#length) to get the length of your shortest path.
4. Use a routing engine of your choice (e.g. Mapbox Directions API) to create "generative" art:
    * Think of ways you might "collaborate" with a routing engine to generate vector drawings. Can you create funky letterforms using street networks? How about generating routes connecting every city called "Paris"?

## Requirements

### Practice and explore

As you work on your final projects, take a break to play around with some of these geospatial provocations!

### Documentation & Organization

Document your process and anything you find intriguing about these explorations. Note down what things you understand and any questions about the concepts or code. Begin remarking any ideas that emerge from these explorations that might lead to further inquiry or ways that these methodologies can be both powerful but also problematic depending on the contexts in which they are operationalized. Document this on your blog.


## Submission

## Additional Exercises:

You can explore some of the below in the [Geosandbox - geo drawing tool](https://joeyklee.github.io/geosandbox/hello-drawing-tool.html)

### Buffer explorations
If you have point data, you can:
  * Create a [Buffer](http://turfjs.org/docs/#buffer) around those points then ...
    * use [Intersect](http://turfjs.org/docs/#intersect) to calculate their intersection and generate polygons of the intersecting space... or 
    * use [Union](http://turfjs.org/docs/#union) to create one polygon of all the buffers

### Grids and density visualizations

Create some sweet Grids:
  * [Square Grid](http://turfjs.org/docs/#squareGrid)
    * 50m
    * 100m
    * 250m
  * [Hexagonal Grid](http://turfjs.org/docs/#hexGrid)
    * 50m
    * 100m
    * 250m
  * [Triangular Grid](http://turfjs.org/docs/#triangleGrid)
    * 50m
    * 100m
    * 250m

Building off the grid data you created above, you can show density or in interesting ways:
    * [Isolines/Contour lines](https://turfjs.org/docs/#isolines)
    * [Triangular Irregular Network](http://turfjs.org/docs/#tin)
    * [Voronoi](http://turfjs.org/docs/#voronoi)

### Showing view direction
Using your data from the streetview mapper, create polygons that show the View direction using the [Field of View - Turf/Sector](https://turfjs.org/docs/#sector)

### Clustering
Use the [kMeans](https://turfjs.org/docs/#clustersKmeans) function to cluster geographic points - see how the algorithm groups points that it thinks are "flocking together"

### Others

There's lots of other geoprocessing algorithms that can yield interesting overviews or generalizations of your data. Here's a few:
* [Convex](https://turfjs.org/docs/#concave)
* [Concave](https://turfjs.org/docs/#convex)
* [Bezier Spline](https://turfjs.org/docs/#bezierSpline) 


<!--

using [turf.js](https://turfjs.org/) to:
1. Create different data derivatives and spatial abstractions from your point data
2. Visualize your spatial abstractions. 

* Spatial Abstraction: Routing, binning, isolines, place search, bezier curves, tin, // other libraries ml5?

 * Using your collected data:
  * A foray into geospatial abstraction of spatial data and APIs: e.g. Routing, binning, isolines, place search, bezier curves, tin, // other libraries ml5?
