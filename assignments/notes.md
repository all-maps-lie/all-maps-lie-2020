## PREREQUISITES

Before you continue, read the [final project briefing](final-project.md). üôè

## READINGS

* See: [Week 1 - Readings](../BIBLIOGRAPHY.md#week-01-everything-is-spatial)

## BRIEF

This week your assignment is to begin observing the environment using @joeyklee's [Streetview Mapper](https://streetview-mapper.org) - a web app that allows you to explore Google Streetview and map what you see to a shared public database. Your task will be to **define ONE subject/phenomenon of interest** and catalog it with the Streetview Mapper and **add hashtags** and **descriptions** to your findings. This practice will continue throughout the duration of the course; the data you collect will be central to grounding the theoretical and practical aspects of this course.

The point of this observational experiment is to train you to focus your attention. Throughout the course, you will be challenged to simultaneously observe and unpack your subject's varying characteristics and qualities and, more interestingly, the subject's history, politics, and geography.

This week, your task is to choose one subject/phenomenon of interest and be meticulous about collecting photographic/geographic evidence of it. There are key constraints to the subject you select, listed below:
* You **may not**:
  * violate the privacy of another person - surveilling without permission is not permitted.
  * choose a subject that will put yourself or another person in danger.
  * do anything illegal 
* You **may**:
  * select a seemingly "simple" subject (simple topics will inevitably lead to complexity, no doubt!)
  * "observe" from afar - if you are particularly passionate about "remote sensing" or remote data collection - your data collection/"paying attention" may take the form of collecting imagery of a specific subject using the web or other platforms.


## Requirements

### Part 1: Selecting a Subject

Choose a subject to observe and write about it. 

Some ideas:
* Stolen bikes or evidence of stolen bikes
* Broken sidewalk infrastructure
* LinkNYC Booths
* Bus Stop Infrastructure
* Telephone Poles
* Vegetation
* Street-side trash bins
* Fire hydrants
* Manhole covers
* Shop signs 
* Link NYC kiosks
* Bus Shelters
* Street Trees
* Security Cameras
* Empty tree beds
* Graffiti
* Trash bins
* Subway Entrances
* Bodegas
* People's Clothes

Some methodological considerations:
* [Paying attention guide](../guides/paying-attention-guide.md)

### Part 2: Begin - Observation

Define a method for your observations and begin data collection. 

* [Create a Google Maps API Key for Streetview Mapper](https://learn.streetview-mapper.org/#/?id=making-a-google-maps-api-key)
* Create an account of [Streetview Mapper](https://streetview-mapper.org/signup)
* Log in [Streetview Mapper](https://streetview-mapper.org/login)

It is important that in this step you do THREE things:
1. Define your rules on what is considered "valid" data (e.g. If we're collecting data about street-side trash bins, do recycling bins also count?)
2. Be meticulous about your data collection. Collecting data willy-nilly is one approach, just be meticulous about your "willy-nilly-ness". You can also consider more systematic approaches. You will need to consider the **spatial distribution** of your subject of interest - e.g. it probably doesnt make sense to map storefront signage in residential suburbs. One approach would be to define a neighborhood to start in and systematically approach your collection street-by-street. 
3. Your data must have at least:
   1. One `#hashtag` that will make your project identifiable. Preferably additional hash tags would be added. This is what you'll use to filter through your data collections later on so make sure to tag your images!
   2. A description of what you have mapped. In case you have observations worth sharing, describe what you're seeing.


### Part 3: Export a GeoJSON of your findings.

In the Streetview Mapper, navigate to the [Dashboard](https://streetview-mapper.org/dashboard). There you can see all of the locations you've saved to the database. 

Here you will do 2 things:
1. Take a screenshot of your dashboard with the full extent of all the points you've mapped.
2. Export all of the data you've cataloged during the week. You can do this by pressing the large green button that says, "**export to geojson**." This will export and save a file called `streetview-mapper__TIMESTAMP.geojson` where `TIMESTAMP` is the Unix timestamp when your data were exported. We will talk more about GeoJSON files and spatial data formats next week.

**Optional**:
You can plot them onto [GeoJSON.io](http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0) by simply *dragging and dropping* your newly created `streetview-mapper__TIMESTAMP.geojson` file into the GeoJSON.io website. Notice in the **right panel** you can see what your data looks like. Particularly of interest are the properties of the geojson that separate the **geometry** from the **properties** of each **feature**.


### Part 4: Begin Research

By now you will have spent some time exploring Streetview and observing instances of your subject of interest. Depending on what you've decided to study, you might on one hand be learning/thinking about that subject for the first time or on the other hand you will have a deep, long history with that subject. Either way, this part of the assignment is to begin researching your subject and articulating your knowledge and findings. 

You will use the [Implosion Methodology](https://journal.culanth.org/index.php/ca/article/view/ca29.2.09/301) to create a "map" - not the geographic kind, but a conceptual one - of the dimensions of your subject. 

In this step, your goal is to go through 14 dimensions of researching a subject to help answer *How Is the World in ‚ÄúIt‚Äù and How Is ‚ÄúIt‚Äù in the World?*. You will try your best to answer the questions associated with each of these dimensions as articulated in the [Implosion Methodology Article](https://journal.culanth.org/index.php/ca/article/view/ca29.2.09/301). Try to limit this to a maximum of 1hr. The point here is that this will provide you with a valuable framework for knowing what you know, acknowledging what you do not, and providing a roadmap for what you might discover throughout the process of mapping:
* Labor dimensions
* Professional/Epistemological dimensions
* Material dimensions
* Technological dimension
* Context and situatedness
* Political dimensions
* Economic dimensions
* Textual dimensions
* Bodily/organic dimensions
* Historical dimensions
* Particle Dimensions
* Educational dimensions
* Mythological dimensions
* Symbolic dimensions
 
You will share the results of your "implosion" in your weekly blog post as described in the next step.

You can use the [Implosion Project Template](templates/implosion-method-template.md) to try to answer as many questions as possible.


### Part 5: Documentation

As part of your week 1 documentation you will submit the following:
1. A blog post that:
   1. **Clearly introduces the subject of urban media you will be studying**: e.g. "For my project, I will be focusing my attention on **street trees**. I define street trees as being..."
   2. **Clearly explains your methodology for data collection**: e.g. "I will be collecting data about **street trees** using Google Streetview. As part of the data collection on **street trees**, I will also collect locations where a tree bed exists but where no tree currently exists. I will start in the Park Slope neighborhood in Brooklyn, then work towards completing Crown heights, then..."
   3. **Clearly shows that you have started to collect data about your subject**. e.g. "In 1 week, I have collected 60 street tree locations. Here is a screenshot of my progress..."
   4. **Clearly shows that you have begin your research using the Implosion Method as described in step 5**

Be sure to note any questions you may have about terminology that you've come across, any concepts that seem confusing, or any technical issues you've encountered. 


## Submission

You will submit a link to your blog post to the link below, specifying which assignment you are submitting:

<!-- 
* Paying Attention: collect data about 1 thing - use your camera phone to collect spatial imagery, organize, annotate, tag, and reflect on what you're seeing. ==> studio time for collecting coordinates.

<!-- 
*   * A1: Paying Attention - assignment is about paying attention: defining a phenomenon to map and observe, learn about, investigate, and report on.

    * or physically based (preferred)
* collect data about 1 thing - use your camera phone to collect spatial imagery, organize, annotate, tag, and reflect on what you're seeing. ==> studio time for collecting coordinates. 
* -->


<!-- As with any research, it is time to do some reading, watching, and digging. 
1. To start, try doing a web search (in your preferred search engine) and seeing what comes up with you put in, for example: "New York city bus stop" or "Hong Kong protest sites" or "Chile public space." You might append additional search terms like: "geography of" or "history of" or "analysis of" etc. 
2. Another starting point would be to examine the academic literature. You can search popular academic article search engines such as (note you will have to VPN into NYU or sign in to your account):
  - The NYU Library
  - Google Scholar
  - or any of [these search engines listed on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_databases_and_search_engines)

As you research, begin to organize your findings, take ample screenshots, and keep track of quotes and references you find useful or meaningful. 

If you've not done the reading, this is also a good time to do so. In particular, **Deep Mapping the Media City** and **Gaps in the Map: The Topologies of Cartography** by Shannon Mattern will help to frame our methdological approaches to the research we are conducting; we use maps and mapping (cartographic methods) as our tools to "excavate" the histories and stories our media subjects might tell (media archaeology). -->

<!-- 
Create a project folder and set it up such that you can keep your data and observations tidy. Document your images in a blog. Add any relevant annotations and notes, reflections, and questions that might be starting to arise about the subject, the methodologies, and anything else that comes to mind.

* Key questions:
  * ...
  * ...
  * ...

Additional Methodological considerations:
* [Googleform guide](../guids/../guides/google-form-guide.md) 
-->

<!-- 
While you're documenting, it is worth thinking about:
* **Articulates at least 3 questions or reflections about**:
   1. The usage of Google Streetview as a data source and mapping platform.
   2. The subject your are studying and what you are curious to discover
* **References at least 3 primary or secondary resources** - articles, videos, interviews - about your subject of interest. 
* 
* -->



<!-- 
Create a spatial dataset, specifically a `geojson` file from your images. Open that geojson file in [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/), a web service that allows you to easily view and make geospatial data, to visualize your data.

* **Automated** process: Ideally you can automate this process by using [img2meta](https://github.com/joeyklee/img2meta) to create a `.geojson` dataset from a folder of images (use the `true` flag). With the `img_metadata.geojson` you can drag-and-drop it into [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/).
* **Manual** process: Otherwise, there are analog methods for retrieving the metadata from your images as seen in [How to See an Image‚Äôs EXIF Data in Windows and macOS, How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/289712/how-to-see-an-images-exif-data-in-windows-and-macos/) in which you can create a `.csv` file or spreadsheet where you can manually create your data. Notes on structuring your spreadsheet data as a CSV and converting it to geojson can be found in the [CSV to GeoJSON Guide](../guides/csv-to-geojson-guide.md).

## READINGS

* See [Week 2 Readings](../BIBLIOGRAPHY.md#week-02-countermaps--cartographics)

## BRIEF

This week your assignment is to create a web map of the data you collected in you one week of data collection (see: [Assignment #1](assignments/assignment_01.md)).

The point here is to explore the web mapping libraries [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and [MapboxGL.js](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) using the [GeoSandbox](https://joeyklee.github.io/geosandbox/) and to get feeling for how you can write JavaScript code to put your data "on the map."

You are more than welcome to try using [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) to explore your data.

## TECHNICAL REFERENCES

* [Technical References](../BIBLIOGRAPHY.md#technical-references)

## Requirements

### Part 1: Continue data collection & research

Continue your **data collection** and **research** you started last week, this should occur in parallel with your web mapping exercises this week.

### Part 2: Export your Streetview Mapper Data

If you have not already done so, do [Assignment 1, Part 3](assignments/assignment_01.md#part-3-export-a-geojson-of-your-findings-and-plot-them-on-a-map). If you have continued your data collection, you can export the latest dataset so you have all the data you've collected thus far.

### Part 3: Create a web map of your streetview locations

Create a web map. Your web map will include the following elements:
1. [Scalebar](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.6.0.html#control-scale)
2. [Zoom Controls](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.6.0.html#control-zoom)
3. [Attribution](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.6.0.html#control-zoom)
4. Information about your map:
   * About the map:
     * [ ] the data collection methods
     * [ ] the author -- you!
     * [ ] the date of creation
     * [ ] the date the map was last updated
   * Where to inlcude:
     * [ ] You can include this in the body of your HTML or you can use the [Leaflet Sidebar V2](https://github.com/nickpeihl/leaflet-sidebar-v2/) for a nice and responsive UI element on your map.

### Part 4: Add data and interactivity to your map

Now that you have your map, you will:
* add your data to the map and 
* add some interactivity to your data. 

In this step you will:
1. Add data: Add your `.geojson` data as a layer on your the map.
2. Add interactivity: For each point add a popup that will show the image that was taken in that location. You will write a loop that will attach the [popup to each marker](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.6.0.html#popup).

Pat yourself on the back! This mapping stuff can be challenging!

### Part 5: Deploy your map to Glitch:

Deploy your map to Glitch. 

* If you're using Git/Github, great! You can deploy to glitch by [following these instructions](https://github.com/itp-dwd/2020-spring/blob/master/guides/glitch.md)
* If you're not using Git/Github, you can simply upload your files using the file uploader. Once you make a blank project in glitch you can use the sidebar to **upload a file** with your `index.html` and other javascript and css files.


### Part 6: Documentation & Organization

Document your process, you understanding or questions about the code, and begin remarking on any patterns you might see when viewing your data on the map. Document this on your blog.

As part of your week 2 documentation you will submit the following:
1. A blog post that:
   1. **Provides a clear update about your data collection and research activities**: "e.g. This week, I continued my data collection of street trees. Since last Monday, I have collected an addtional 40 trees. I have started to identify some trends and patterns based on the data I've collected so far. So far, I have noticed: ... In reading the literature on urban vegetation, I've found that street tree health is related to many factors such as availablity of water which on a microscale can be influenced by the building density and materials of the buildings surrounding the tree... Street trees provide many benefits according to research published in X..."
   2. **Provides the link to your published web map**: In your blog post you will provide screenshots of your web map describing what you did to produce the map. You will provide references to code you used and/or any additional materials of relevance. e.g. "Here is a web map I produced using the tutorial provided here..."
   3. **Provides at least 3 points of reflection on the usage of open source mapping tools**: Provide some feedback about why open source mapping tools may or may not be important or relevant for research.

## Submission

You will submit a link to your blog post to the link below, specifying which assignment you are submitting:

 # A3: Spatial Abstraction

## Brief

This week your assignment is to explore different geo-spatial data processing methods using [turf.js](https://turfjs.org/) to:
1. Create different data derivatives and spatial abstractions from your point data
2. Visualize your spatial abstractions.

## Readings

* See [Week 3 Readings](../BIBLIOGRAPHY.md#week-03-maps-as-media)

## Technical References

* [Geosandbox - Turf.js](https://joeyklee.github.io/geosandbox/hello-turf.html)

## Requirements

### Part 1: Spatial Abstractions

* Create the following geojson data abstractions from your point data:
  * [Buffer]() and ...
    * [Intersect]()
    * [Union]()
  * Grids:
    * [Square Grid]()
      * 50m
      * 100m
      * 250m
    * [Hexagonal Grid]()
      * 50m
      * 100m

  * Clustering:
    * [kMeans]()
  * Overview:
    * [Convex]()
    * [Concave]()
    * [Bezier Spline]()

### Part 2: Visualization

Visualize the data abstractions on the map. Style the visual properties appropriately. 

You may consider importing your geojson data into [Kepler.gl]() to explore the data using the GUI rather than through code. 

### Part 3: Documentation & Organization

Document your process, you understanding or questions about the code, and begin remarking on any patterns you might see when viewing your data on the map. Document this on your blog.

* Key questions:
  * What stories do these different spatial abstractions and data derivatives tell? 
  * ...
  * ...


 # A4: Locative Media

## Brief

This week your assignment is to create a locative media experience using the data you have been collecting. Your locative media piece **must interact with physical space** (or a reconstruction of physical space) in such a way that communicates some aspect of the data you've collected.

Some prompts that you may draw from:
* Build a "compass" that guides and directs you to the physical locations of your data.
* Create a walking tour that highlights aspects of your data.
* Create an ephemeral sculpture (e.g. with long-exposure photography, see note on chalk or tape below).
* Use your geolocation to prevent an event from occurring in promity to a data point.
* Use your geolocation to trigger an event in proximity to a data point.

NOTE: Be careful for ways in which your interventions might be classified as graffiti or defacement of property - [Chalk a Sidewalk, Go to Jail, MotherJones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/08/war-chalk-arrests/).

You must document how you or others are meant to experience your piece. **The documentation (images and/or video) is the output** in this assignment. Emphasis should be given to communicating the concept of your locative media experience and not just be a technical implementation or prototype. 

## Readings

* See [Week 4 Readings](../BIBLIOGRAPHY.md#week-04-locative-media)

## Technical References

* ...


## Requirements

### Part 1: Concept

Define a concept for your locative media experience. Your concept documentation must include:
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

### Part 2: Prototyping and Implementation

Prototype and develop your concept. Document with photos and video how your locative media work is experienced. Add your video to [Vimeo](vimeo.com/) or [Youtube](youtube.com/) or some other media streaming service that can be accessed by the public.

### Part 3: Documentation & Organization

Document your process, the results of your locative media experience, and blog about your concept and implementation.

* Key questions:
  * Explain your concept. How is your concept appropriate for your data? How does your implementation express your concept.
  * What does your locative media experience intend to highlight?
