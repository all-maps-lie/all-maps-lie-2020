## FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL DUE

The final project briefing outlines the requirements for the written and presentational portions of the final project proposal. Completing your proposal should be your main focus this week. 

- [PROPOSAL](assignments/final-project.md#proposal)
  - [PART 1: WRITTEN PROPOSAL](assignments/final-project.md#part-1-written-proposal)
  - [PART 2: VIDEO PROPOSAL PRESENTATION](assignments/final-project.md#part-2-video-proposal-presentation)

As part of your final project proposal preparation you may consider to practice your new mapping skills using Kepler.gl (see: [kepler.gl guide](../guides/keplergl-guide.md)) that we learned about in class. You can use those maps and initial data visualizations as material in your proposal! 

## Web Mapping Practice (optional)

Revisit the [kepler.gl guide](../guides/keplergl-guide.md) and try exploring different data. 

What kinds of different visualizations do different data types afford you? What can you do with points that you can't do with lines? What about polygons?

As you explore different data driven visualizations, ask yourself this question: [Is the data standardized or does it need to be](https://www.axismaps.com/guide/data/standardizing-data/)?
