# Geo Knowledge Guide

A vastly reductive, but attempt to catalog some of the major touchpoints of what I might consider "geographic knowledge" or thinking. This will  give you an idea of things to aspire to given that we will barely scratch the surface of just a handful of these topics. 

# Geography - Human & Physical

Capital "G" Geography has more to do than state capitols and maps. In fact, a lot of Geography has nothing to do with those things or is about problematizing or critiquing those things. 

What Geography is for me is about considering geography - society and space - with regards to a topic. In one Geography department, you might have people studying any number of things including: the "Geography of Scandanavian Death Metal", the "Geography of youth radicalization in recently immigrated populations", "The effects of sediment runoff in glacial melt", and "The effects of street trees in atmospheric turbulence in a suburban neighborhood." The point is that central to Geographers approach and understanding of the world is that the geographic context is critical to understanding/appreciating a thing.

# Remote Sensing

Remote sensing gets its own category because in the end, Remote Sensing is really about physics (of light), chemistry, and computation.

# Everything Besides the Map

No one told me when I started getting into maps that basically mapping is about more than "just" putting things on a map. There's a whole "stack" of things that are not directly related to "maps" per se, but are totally essential for making mapping possible.
