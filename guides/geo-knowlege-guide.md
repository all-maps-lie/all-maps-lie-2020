# Geo Knowledge Guide

A vastly reductive, but valiant attempt to catalog some of the major touch points of what I might consider "geographic knowledge" or thinking. This will give you an idea of things to aspire to given that we will barely scratch the surface of just a handful of these topics.

This guide is important because it covers some of the domains of interest that are helping to theoretically and practically frame the course.

# Geography - Human & Physical

Capital "G" Geography is more than just state capitols and maps. In fact, a lot of Geography has nothing to do with those things and is rather about problematizing or critiquing those things. 

Capital "G" Geography is about considering the geography of a place and its role in shaping and being shaped by some aspect of social or physical processes. In any given Geography department, you might have people studying any number of things including: the "Geography of Scandanavian Death Metal", the "Geography of youth radicalization in recently immigrated populations", "The effects of sediment runoff in glacial melt", and "The effects of street trees in atmospheric turbulence in suburban neighborhoods" - the breadth and depth of expertise couldn't be greater! 

The point here is that, for Geographers and the discipline of Geography, the geographic context is critical to understanding/appreciating the history, politics, culture, physical nature of a phenomenon. This may seem like a given, but other disciplines do not prioritize or sometimes even consider spatial context or localization as a relevant factor.

For the purpose of this class, I think it is helpful to introduce some of these disciplinary concepts (though the boundaries can be fuzzy) to help give you an overview of where you might situate your work. 

## Human Geography

Human geography is concerned with human processes. These processes include topics across a range of disciplines such as economics, demographics, political science, psychology, sociology, gender studies, queer studies, media studies, history, and more. Often times these disciplines get framed as `________` Geography such as Economic Geography, Political Geography, War Geography, Feminist Geography, and so on.

## Physical Geography

Physical geography is concerned with biophysical processes. These processes include topics across a range of disciplines such as geomorphology, meteorology, climatology, biogeography, ecology, soil science, forestry, hydrology, atmospheric science, and more. To be a physical geographer often means you studied within a Geography department, learning to consider the deep importance of geography - social and physical contexts - in shaping society and space all the while focusing on some realm of the environmental sciences.

## The need for both

The divisions between Human and Physical Geography are definitely real. Whether disagreements occur over methodological approaches or theoretical ones, it can be pretty surprising how different these two approaches to Geography can be. However different the two types of Geography may be, I would argue for the necessity for both to live together. The beauty of having these sometimes radically different universes colliding together is that it can help us to consider as many perspectives, impacts, and realities of the same phenomenon.

For instance, let's take an Urban Geography example. Imagine that the city of New York is trying to start a program to offer carbon offsetting credits at the neighborhood scale for maintaining street trees and other urban vegetation. *Physical geographers* studying urban ecology might offer up their skills and use a combination of aerial imagery to quantify the number of trees in the city and then use physical measurements of sap flow on a sample of trees throughout the city to understand their health. This could easily be the end of the story, however, the implications of this exercise become apparent by way of Human Geography research. Taking this thought experiment further, *Human geographers* might launch a critique against this approach because such  quantification may disadvantage neighborhoods who have historically not had the capacity or funding to maintain the trees and vegetation around them. Furthermore, Human Geographers might be the first to point out how historically, racist policies have pushed black and other minority groups to environmentally unfavorable locations that might be less conducive for healthy plants. Taken together, the city might have a more holistic understanding of A) how to undertake such a study/employ such a policy and B) how to ensure that we do not reinforce legacies of racist or unfair policies that further disadvantage people and communities. The back and forth between these two modes of thinking and their approaches are what make Geographic thinking important for how we approach complexity in the world! 

Aside: I will acknowledge there are lots of people who fall in between Human and Physical geography and even more people who don't even recognize that the work they are doing might even be classified as existing in this "third space." I might be one example of this. While I am all for the radical overlaps, interdisciplinary collaborations and remixing, I think recognizing disciplinary histories and politics is super important and therefore am not sure about "antidisciplinarity" as a solution but rather just another approach (with mixed feelings ðŸ˜¬). 

## Why this matters

You may be thinking, so what? Why is this relevant for me in this class?

This matters because this is what we are going to practice in this class: simultaneously embracing and critiquing geography and technology. 

We are going to be using tools and methodologies that can change *how we understand* geography (think: the Physical geographers above) all the while critiquing (think: Guman geographers above):
* A) those understandings, their limits, and their implications and 
* B) the tools, the data, and knowledge that frame *how we understand* and *what we can understand* about the geographies we are exploring.

What's exciting is that at least by recognizing the existence of such disciplines, you may find literature and projects that help you to frame your work in past and present research. IMHO there's nothing more exciting that reading a book or article where every sentence seems to eloquently articulate all those thoughts in my brain!

# Everything Besides the Map

No one told me when I started getting into maps that basically mapping is about more than "just" putting things on a map. There's a whole "stack" of things that are not directly related to "maps" per se, but are totally essential for making mapping possible.
