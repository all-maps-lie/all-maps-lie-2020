# Guide: Paying Attention

## ABOUT

This is a guide about paying attention. Specifically it is a guide to help you pay attention through the practice of data collection. 

Emphasis here is focused on "simple" solutions for data collection. 


# CONCEPTUAL

## Defining a prompt

As seen in [Rob Walker's How To Pay Attention: 20 Ways To Win The War Against Seeing](https://medium.com/re-form/how-to-pay-attention-4751adb53cb6), you can define a "simple" prompt -- simple in the sense that the constraints are well defined -- that narrows your focus to an object of interest or specific focal points.

For example some of these focued, but abstract prompts include:
* Conduct an overlooked-object scavenger hunt 
* Conduct a single-color scavenger hunt
* Spot something new every day
* Reframe the familiar
* Talk to a stranger
* Let a stranger lead you

## Asking a seemingly simple question

Learning to ask a "simple" question is both an art and a practice. Simple questions are often misconstrued as naive when in reality they are often the starting point to full fledged investigation. 

Asking a seemingly simple question is a wonderful way to focus your attention with the goal of answering (or attempting to answer) your question.

For example:
* How many pools are in LA?
* How many empty tree beds are there in NYC?
* What is the diversity of the fonts on storefronts on Broadway?


Notice what these questions have in common?
* Each asks a questions about:
  * something countable
  * something categorizable

These seemingly simple questions are the starting point for many other questions about the phenomenon of interest. These other questions can address:
* How they relate to current culture and politics?
* What do they tell about the history of the phenomenon? Or about the history of the place?

## A few helpful notes

Neff & Nafus in “The Self-Tracking” (ch.3) identify 10 practice tracking considerations: 

* Start with brevity
* Focus on one thing (or two things maximum!)
* Name those things with care
* Time and location are good data curators
* Be realistic about the work
* Numbers, words, and pictures all count
* Numbers have qualities
* Words and pictures have quantities
* Self-tracking tools do not have to be fancy
* Do a few trial runs

Data collection is a habit and takes practice. You can think about ways to help make data collection a part of your habits, particularly if the phenomenon of interest for you is something you want to explore over the long term. Some helpful tips:

* Build Reward structures and mechanisms for encouragement
* Trial and error is common - finding out the best mechanisms for you takes time
* Define a baseline from which you can explore or measure change. Do you have a baseline? The importance of baselines is best described in [Control Earth (2016), P. Edwards](https://placesjournal.org/article/control-earth/)
