# Guide: Paying Attention

## ABOUT

This is a guide about paying attention. Specifically it is a guide to help you pay attention through the practice of data collection. 

Emphasis here is focused on "simple" solutions for data collection. 


# CONCEPTUAL

## Defining a prompt

As seen in [Rob Walker's How To Pay Attention: 20 Ways To Win The War Against Seeing](https://medium.com/re-form/how-to-pay-attention-4751adb53cb6), you can define a "simple" prompt -- simple in the sense that the constraints are well defined -- that narrows your focus to an object of interest or specific focal points.

For example some of these focued, but abstract prompts include:
* Conduct an overlooked-object scavenger hunt 
* Conduct a single-color scavenger hunt
* Spot something new every day
* Reframe the familiar
* Talk to a stranger
* Let a stranger lead you

## Asking a seemingly simple question

Learning to ask a "simple" question is both an art and a practice. Simple questions are often misconstrued as naive when in reality they are often the starting point to full fledged investigation. 

Asking a seemingly simple question is a wonderful way to focus your attention with the goal of answering (or attempting to answer) your question.

For example:
* How many pools are in LA?
* How many empty tree beds are there in NYC?
* What is the diversity of the fonts on storefronts on Broadway?


Notice what these questions have in common?
* Each asks a questions about:
  * something countable
  * something categorizable

These seemingly simple questions are the starting point for many other questions about the phenomenon of interest. These other questions can address:
* How they relate to current culture and politics?
* What do they tell about the history of the phenomenon? Or about the history of the place?


# TECHNICAL

## PHONE PHOTOGRAPHY

You phone's camera is a powerful for two reasons:
1. It lives in your pocket - "the best camera you have is the one that you have on you"
2. Spatial Metadata - your photos (if location services are enabled) will have location data and other metadata about where the photo was taken.
3. The "data" is easily stored and organized. 


### DATA COLLECTION

On a simple level, you can think of your camera phone as:
1. point
2. shoot

To get a bit more detailed, you can start defining rules like:
1. All photos are taken in landscape mode (vs. portrait mode).
2. All subjects in the photo are centered directly in the middle.
3. All photos will be in color (as opposed to black and white).
4. Photos can be taken in nighttime and daytime.

   
And to get even more detailed still, you can add to your list of rules:
1. TBD

### DATA PROCESSING

On a simple level, you can process your data like:
1. All photos will be stored in a folder called "Paying Attention Project"
2. All photos will be added to a blog post with a caption.

To get a bit more detailed:
1. All photos will be named like so: `YYYYMMDD__name-of-object__latitude__longitude.jpg`
2. All photos will include metadata description of the information in the image and any notes collected about that image.

To get even more detailed and sophisticated:
1. Every time a photo is loaded to my computer, I will run a script that will export a JSON file that includes, for each image, the name of the image, the location information, and any associated metadata. The script will also generate an interactive map of those locations.
