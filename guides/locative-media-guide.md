# Locative Media Guide

Have you ever followed Google Maps to get you from A to B? have you ever played Pokemon Go? Do you live in a country that has enabled contact tracing for epidemiological tracking? If you've answered "yes" to any of the above, quite likely you've interacted with *locative media* in one shape or another.

From the more applied, direction based media to those that are more poetic in their intention, locative media create new interactions with physical space and place. 

## What is locative media?

Paraphrased from Wikipedia:
    Locative media (aka location-based media) concentrates on social interaction with a place and with technology...Many locative media projects have a social, critical or personal (memory) background. 
    
    Locative Media are those that are functionally bound to a location but don’t necessarily need to speak directly about that place. The media can be a mechanism to connect you to some other geography
    
    Most locative media works are functionally enabled by location aware technologies including GPS, wifi, bluetooth, etc.

From [About Locative Media](http://themobilecity.nl/background-information/about-locative-media/).. 

  In the edition of the Leonardo Electronic Almanac on locative media, Julian Bleecker defines locative media as follows:

      “Locative media that is of most immediate concerns is that made by those who create experiences that take into account the geographic locale of interest, typically by elevating that geographic locale beyond its instrumentalized status as a ‘latitude longitude coordinated point on earth’ to the level of existential, inhabited, experienced and lived place. These locative media experiences may delve “into” the historical surface of a space to reveal past events or stories (whether fictional, confessional or standing on consensus as factual). Locative media experiences may also cross space, connecting experiences across short or long geographic, experiential, or temporal distances. **At its core, locative media is about creating a kind of geospatial experience whose aesthetics can be said to rely upon a range of characteristics ranging from the quotidian to the weighty semantics of lived experience, all latent within the ground upon which we traverse**.”

  ...

  Combining these different points of view, we can differentiate between (at least) six ways in which locative and mobile media can transform our notions of urban culture.

    + **Spatial Database Usage**: The use of spatially organized interfaces to information databases, for instance Google Earth-mash ups or TomTom devices.
    + **Space/Place Attribution**: The annotation of geographic places (and the attribution, construction and contestation of maps, meaning, and territories)
    + **Networking** The mapping or tracing of objects and persons and the use of locative media as tools for micro-coordination such as realtime and realspace social networking.
    + **Space Communication** The use of locative media as filtering devices: either selecting relevant places from the perspective of the subject. Or the other way around: systems that grant or refusing access to certain places.
    + **Space formation** The use of locative media as a ‘space making devices’, altering the experience of a certain space through its use. For instance mobile phones or personal stereo’s.
    + **Metaphorical Layering**: The issue of address: framing space and/or subjects in a certain way, providing us with ontologic metaphors, starting to understand our subjectivities in other ways.

  (NOTE: I've added those category names!)
  ...

  Michiel de Lange classifies of locative media by writing:
      "Locative media technologies are used (i) for navigation and orientation in wayfinding; (ii) to measure and visualize what is otherwise not visible; (iii) to annotate physical locations with digital information; (iv) to organize social interactions; (v) for pervasive games. In addition, I argue that play not only occurs in pervasive games but informs the other categories as well. Furthermore, in all categories locative media induce us to reflect on ourselves in spatial terms."

## Locative Media Sampler

IMHO there is not a super clear boundary between works that are or are not "locative media." The range in locative media works is broad but I think the common thread that ties these works together is the way that each project makes properties of location prominent in their respective narratives.

### Ground Truths / Seeing the Invisible

In this first exploration, we look at projects that I've classified as "ground truths" or ways of confirming or observing something "on the ground." 

The image juxtopsed here shows on on the left a satellite ground truth that helps satellites and aerial imaging planes calibrate from space - by examining the images taken over the same spot, you can determine if the sensors are behaving the same over time - and on the right images from Kodak's skin tone testing images for their film aka "china girls" or "shirly cards". What I think is interesting here is that both are means of calibration and each reveals something deeper about the systems which produced those outcomes. Some immediate themes that emerge are things around robot readable landscapes and the implications and history of the male gaze in image processing image processing and image creation.  

In this section we'll look at examples where location is central to expressing certain kinds of truths. 

* We start with James Bridle's Drone Shadows. 
* Then Waterlicht by Studio Roosengaarde
* Then Catherine D'ignazio's Boston Coastline :future past
* A local project by Goddemeyer & Bauer called subspotting
* Julian Oliver's border bumping
* Heike Otten's Urban Flaneur
* Hyper-reality - keiichi matsuda




### Compasses / Navigation and Orientation

We take some time next to look at compases and means of navigation

* beeline
* Maptic, Emilios Farrington-Arnas
  * short discussion on why we can't rely solely on maps
* Fatalatour by david leonard
