## What is a spatial join?


A [spatial join](https://gisgeography.com/spatial-join/) is a special type of [attribute join](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/tables/joining-attributes-in-one-table-to-another.htm) that uses the spatial relationships of two datasets to calculate if/how data can be linked, merged, or *joined* from one dataset to another.
