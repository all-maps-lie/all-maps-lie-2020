## FieldPapers

[Fieldpapers](fieldpapers.org/) is a project by Stamen, a SF based design and mapping agency. The project is meant to help in creating GeoTIFFs (basically Tiff images that have geospatial data associated with it) from printed paper maps with annotations and notes.


### DATA COLLECTION

#### Step 1 - Preparation: make an atlas

1. Make an atlas - a printed paper map from [fieldpapers.org](http://fieldpapers.org/compose#19/40.69401/-73.98982)

My recommendation would be the OSM tiles. The satellite imagery doesn't come out well in black-and-white!


#### Step 2: Go out and map

2. Add pins, notes, and drawings to your paper. Use a bright colored marker or pen, use sticky notes or stickers. 

### DATA PROCESSING

#### Step 3: Take a picture of your map
3. Take a picture of your map

#### Step 4: Upload your map
4. Upload your map to [fieldpapers.org/snapshots/new](http://fieldpapers.org/snapshots/new) to create a GeoTIFF of your map.

#### Step 5: Download the outputs
5. Download the GeoTIFF and save the URL to your map.
