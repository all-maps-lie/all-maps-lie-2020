# Week 1: Everything is Spatial

> “A map does not just chart, it unlocks and formulates meaning; it forms bridges between here and there, between disparate ideas that we did not know were previously connected.” ― Reif Larsen, The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet 
> 
> “If the theoretical critique cleared conceptual space for alternative mappings it has fallen to a variety of practices, most of them outside of the academy… 2 developments are especially notable: artistic appropriations of mapping and the storming success of map hacking, mashups, and the geospatial web” - Crampton (2010)

## ABOUT

Welcome! If you're here, this means you're taking All Maps Lie. Thanks for being here.

This week we are going to get acquainted with mapping and cartography *through the lens of design & media art and critical perspectives*. We are going to challenge our conceptions and definitions of what a map is, what they can be, who is mapping, what maps say, and what maps do. This week our goal is to "[align our compass](http://www.wordsinspace.net/mapsmedia/fall2018/portfolio/august-29-calibrating-the-compass/)" and begin aligning our media art practices with critical cartographic discourse.

This week we will focus on "paying attention" through environmental observations and data collection.

### Final Project Brief

Your final project for this course starts today. Everything that you do will be in service of a final, cohesive work that speaks to the final project briefing. Each of the assignments will be a part of your final project and therefore it is crucial to keep in mind what we are building towards. 

* ↳ [Final Project Brief](../assignments/final-project.md)


### Defining Student Blocks and Groups

You may choose to work in groups IF you'd like (no more than 2 per group), however, these blocks and groups are more for assigning to help create some structure of accountability between yourselves. Consider the people in your groups as your first points of contact for questions and feedback. 

* Block 1
  * Group A: Paper Town
    * Max
    * Ji
    * Caleb
    * Paulami
  * Group B: Bermuda Triangle
    * Winnie
    * Emma
    * Julian
    * Ruixian
* Block 2
  * Group C: Null Island
    * Guillermo
    * Sydney
    * Monni
    * Martin
  * Group D: Mind Map
    * Karina
    * Tirta
    * Tianxu
    * Pablo


### Course Introduction

* **Everything is Spatial**
  * **Introduction**
    * Everything has a geography.
    * Geography is important. Geography matters. It shapes us and we shape it. How it is shaped, and who shapes it is political. 
    * One tool for understanding geography is mapping/maps. 
    * So what are we going to do in this class then? We’re going to do our best. We are going to do our best to learn as much as we can, to think about geography as much as we can, and think about what it means to express geography in the form of maps. 
    * The Floating Sheep Manifesto captures how we will be approaching these ambivalencies -- and what we will come to know as the tensions -- in geography and mapping. 
  * **Setting the Stage**
    * A personal story of mapping and coming to know the many shades of "maps"
    * The authority and power of maps
    * Cartographic Securitization vs. Resistances
    * Cartographic Silences and what comes as a result
    * Cartographic Anxieties
      * Disciplinary anxieties
      * Anxieties about what maps can do
    * A call to action for critical mapping and critique
    * “A prismatic collection of mappings” - The Third Way
    * Mapping & finding our place in the world

<!-- 


<!-- We will be exploring the following concepts in today's class:
* Key concepts:
  * "Situated Knowledges"
  * Production of Space
* We will ask:
  * What is a map? who maps? and to what end?
* We will see exampples of:
    * Reference maps
    * Thematic maps -->


<!-- * Situating "mapping"
  * Who maps? 
  * What is being mapped? 
  * and to what ends?
* Situating our approach: Artists shaping (and being shaped by) spatial media
  * Why are we are mapping?
  * What will we be mapping?
  * How will we be mapping? -->


IGNORE
* What is a map? what can a map be?
  * Everything is Spatial - overview of mapping, what it is/isn't, what it can be, and what it means for us in media art/design.
  * * Setting the stage:
  * What is a map? And Why it doesn't matter
  * Why do we map?
  * Who maps?
* Course goals:
  * To practice paying attention 
  * To ask geographic questions 
  * To explore spatial media
  * To learn together
