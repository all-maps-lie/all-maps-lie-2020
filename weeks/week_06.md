# Week 6: Figure-Ground

## SLIDES
* ↳ [Link to Slides]()

## ABOUT

The theme this week is "figure-ground." Figure-ground is often referred to ways we perceive what is in an image as differentiated as the subject and background. This is a fitting frame of reference for ways that we read maps in the form of aerial images and remotely sensed data. 

This week we will focus on "remotely sensed" data in the form of images. Using the data you have been collecting, you will explore imagery from the top-down and the bottom-up, juxtaposing views collected from aerial imagery and those from streetview data services.

<!-- # Week 6: Experimental Geography

> “Map artists… claim the power of the map to achieve ends other than the social reproduction of the status quo. Map artists do not reject maps. They reject the authority claimed by normative maps uniquely to portray reality as it is (Wood, 2006). - via Crampton (2010)
>
> “The artistic community has long experimented with maps, their meaning as representations and as efforts to find our place in the world” (Casey 2002; kanarinka 2006) - from Crampton (2010)

## ABOUT

This week our theme is "Experimental Geography." This refers to artwork that lives at the intersections of art, design, architecture, science, and the humanities as well as to the approach we've been taking in this class. The discussion this week will be on articulating what it means to be "critical," how it relates to cartographic and mapping practices, and more generally to how we read the world. 

This week we will focus on documenting our work, synthesizing our experiences, and making sense of our projects. The outcomes will be included in our class zine.
