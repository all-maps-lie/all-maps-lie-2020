# Week 6: Experimental Geography

> “Map artists… claim the power of the map to achieve ends other than the social reproduction of the status quo. Map artists do not reject maps. They reject the authority claimed by normative maps uniquely to portray reality as it is (Wood, 2006). - via Crampton (2010)
>
> “The artistic community has long experimented with maps, their meaning as representations and as efforts to find our place in the world” (Casey 2002; kanarinka 2006) - from Crampton (2010)
