## ABOUT

This week you will be introduced to some fundamental concepts of remote sensing. We will learn about the ways the light shape what we see and what we might know about the natural and built world. We will look at the potential and opportunities for remote sensing to be used for creative expression.

Lastly we will review and conclude the class in preparation for our final presentations next week.

## ABOUT

This week our theme is "Experimental Geography." This refers to artwork that lives at the intersections of art, design, architecture, science, and the humanities as well as to the approach we've been taking in this class. The discussion this week will be on articulating what it means to be "critical," how it relates to cartographic and mapping practices, and more generally to how we read the world. 

This week we will focus on documenting our work, synthesizing our experiences, and making sense of our projects. The outcomes will be included in our class zine.

<!-- The theme this week is "figure-ground." Figure-ground is often referred to ways we perceive what is in an image as differentiated as the subject and background. This is a fitting frame of reference for ways that we read maps in the form of aerial images and remotely sensed data. 

This week we will focus on "remotely sensed" data in the form of images. Using the data you have been collecting, you will explore imagery from the top-down and the bottom-up, juxtaposing views collected from aerial imagery and those from streetview data services. -->

* Week 6: figure-ground
  * How do we see from sensors above and what can we see?
    * active sensing
      * radar or rather SAR - synthetic aperature radar
        * using microwave radiation emitted from the sensor, you get a two-way return time of the signal where the time and strength is an indication of depth or height.
        * due to the length of the microwaves, they can penetrate through clouds, sand, clouds (water) 
        * we also see radar being used on self-driving cars!
      * lidar
        * using UV, visible, and NIR pulses of light emitted from the sensor, you get a two-way return time of the signal where the time and strength is an indication of depth or height.
        * can be used to look upwards (e.g. looking at atmospheric aerosols)
        * and/or downward to examine things like building or tree forest canopy heights 
        * or sideways to map streets and objects like on self-driving cars!
