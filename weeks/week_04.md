## ABOUT

This week, the theme is "Spatial Abstraction." In our class today we will take a few *excursions* exploring different ways that geographic data are abstracted to produce outcomes that seek to provoke, to control, to question, or to delight. 

We will discuss examples ranging from AI based aerial image classification methods to different "personalities" of routing engines. On one hand we'll examine ways that geospatial data can be processed to enforce certain policies and perspectives and on the other how re-renderings of space and place can help to shape how we see the world.
