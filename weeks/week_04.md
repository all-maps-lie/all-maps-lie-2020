# Week 4: Locative Media

> “If you break from cartesian space what new perspectives will be thrown up?... what strange conjunctions and serendipitous new knowledges?” - Crampton (2010)

## ABOUT

The theme this week is "locative media." The discussion will be focused around the ways that mapping can be experienced outside of the screen /paper. We will examine the geographies of spatial data and the power of "seeing" data in space. Exploring the geography of spatial data means looking at both physical spaces and digital infrastructures.

This week we will focus on getting "out of the screen" and into space. Using the data you have been collecting, you will explore ways of creating interventions or provocations in physical space that highlight, visualize, or prompt engagement with your data.
