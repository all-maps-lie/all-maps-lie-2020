# Week 3: Maps as Media

> Maps are not representational by “processual” - that is they emerge on through practices and not through definitions - (Kitchen & dodge 2007)
>
> “Is it possible to think of a map not as a representation of reality but as a tool to produce reality?” - Kanarinka (2006)
>
> “In the process, [map amateurs] are reshaping the world of mapmaking and collectively creating a new atlas that is lieky to be both richer and messier than any other” - Helft 2007, New York Times
