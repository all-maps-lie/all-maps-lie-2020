# Week 3: Thinking about space

> Maps are not representational by “processual” - that is they emerge on through practices and not through definitions - (Kitchen & dodge 2007)
>
> “Is it possible to think of a map not as a representation of reality but as a tool to produce reality?” - Kanarinka (2006)
>
> “In the process, [map amateurs] are reshaping the world of mapmaking and collectively creating a new atlas that is lieky to be both richer and messier than any other” - Helft 2007, New York Times

    * Geocoding
    * Attribute Joins
    * Spatial Joins
  * Creating thematic maps:
    * Kepler.gl
    * DataWrapper
      * maps support
    * leaflet.js
      * maptime boston tutorial
      * geosandbox
      * leaflet.js starter
    * QGIS

<!-- 
* New Spatial Media:
  * map mashups, false correlations? 
  * open source 
  * visualization: turf binning - grids, isolines
  * https://turfjs.org/docs/#tesselate

<!-- This week our theme is "Maps as Media." We build off of our discussions from last week to dive deeper into ways that space is "calculated," how that manifests in shaping the world, and what that means for us as those who are simultaneously mapping and being mapped.

This week we will focus on spatial abstraction and how we can use and abuse different geospatial tools and APIs to explore spatial data. Using the data we have been collecting and our exposure to web mapping from last week, we will take a look at various methods for calculating space using turf.js. -->
