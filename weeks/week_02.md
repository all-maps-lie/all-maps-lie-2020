## ABOUT

This week we are going to focus on answering three main questions:
1. What does it mean for something to have a location?
2. How do we translate location onto maps?
3. What makes a (web) map?

<!-- 
 This week is called "Countermaps and Cartographics." "Countermaps" refer to efforts to map "against dominant power structures" and "Cartographics" are reference to the visual manifestations of various spatial mappings. These terms are relevant for us because we will be focusing on ways in which our contributions - albeit still in their early stages - can be framed as mini "resistances." 

This week will be exploring how "countermaps" and "cartographics" can take the form of "map mashups and new spatial media" and how they relate to media art/creative technology. Our discussion will address this question "what is critique?" and the role that media art/creative tech interventions may play in shaping cartographic discourse. The discussion will explore how the changing landscape of tools and participants in mapping and map making have shaped who, how, and what maps operate in the world. 

This week we will focus on web mapping "map mashups." Using the data we collected from last week, we will take a look at programmatic methods for making interactive maps using Leaflet.js. We will also take a look at Kepler.gl, a web-based GUI tool for visualizing spatial data.

**Chapter 2:**
1. What is critique? How can mapping be critical? The concept of "Situated Knowledges" and the production of space
2. Basic Principles of Critical Cartography
   1. Via Crampton
      1. Critique has a number of basic principles. First, it examines the (often unexamined) grounds of our decision-making knowledges; second it situates knowledge in specific historical periods and geographic spaces (rather than being universal for all time); third it seeks to uncover the relationship between power and knowledge; and fourth it resists, challenges, and sometimes overthrows our categories of thought. The purpose of critique is not to say that our knowledge is not true, but that the truth of knowledge is established under conditions that have a lot to do with power. Critique is therefore a politics of knowledge. Crampton, Jeremy W.. Mapping (Critical Introductions to Geography) . Wiley. Kindle Edition. 
   2. Via Blomley
      1. 1. It is oppositional: it targets dominant forms of oppression or inequalities. 2. It is activist and practical: it wishes to change the world. 3. It is theoretic: it rejects positivist explanation and embraces critical social theory. Crampton, Jeremy W.. Mapping (Critical Introductions to Geography) . Wiley. Kindle Edition. ... Critical cartography and GIS is only in part a matter of scholarship, for the other half of our one–two punch, we have to turn to actual interventions, protests, transformations, and community mappings. Included in this would also be art work, blogs, mashups, and the “geospatial” web. Crampton, Jeremy W.. Mapping (Critical Introductions to Geography) . Wiley. Kindle Edition. 
   3. In sum:
      1. 1. The first principle of critical mapping is that maps are incredibly useful ways of organizing and producing knowledge about the world, but that these orders of knowledge also incorporate unexamined assumptions which act as limits which deserve to be challenged. 2. One way to challenge these orders of knowledge is by putting them into historical perspective. This historicization of knowledge not only shows that other times did things differently, but by providing an intellectual history it allows us to see the edges of our own limits, and to conceive of other knowledges that might be useful. Critical mapping also emphasizes that the way maps and spatial knowledges have been deployed has varied tremendously between cultures and places. This can be described as a spatialization of knowledge. 3. Critical mapping also holds that geographic knowledge is shaped by a whole array of social, economic, and historical forces, so that knowledge does not exist except in relation to power. When we speak of maps as political, it is this relationship between knowledge and power that is at stake. 4. The critical mapping project is also one which has an activist, emancipatory flavor to it. Sometimes this approach is concerned with overthrowing the influence of official knowledges (such as those of the government or the state) by showing their historical and spatial contingency (Livingstone 2003; Sparke 1998). At other times this approach seeks to dismantle more specific forms of knowledge, such as recent work by feminists in critical GIS or community activism in participatory GIS (Elwood 2006b; Kwan 2002a; Schuurman 2002). Crampton, Jeremy W.. Mapping (Critical Introductions to Geography) . Wiley. Kindle Edition. 
3. Maps are active; they actively construct knowledge, they exercise power and they can be a powerful means of promoting social change. Crampton, Jeremy W.. Mapping (Critical Introductions to Geography) . Wiley. Kindle Edition. 
4. Wood argued that maps express the interests of certain groups and that these interests are not always explicit. Crampton, Jeremy W.. Mapping (Critical Introductions to Geography) . Wiley. Kindle Edition. 
5. Rejecting the binary oppositions until then dominant in cartography, such as art/science, objective/subjective, and scientific/ideological, Harley sought to situate maps as social documents that needed to be understood in their historical contexts.
