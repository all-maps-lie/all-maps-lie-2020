# Week 2: Countermaps and Cartographics

## ABOUT

This week is called "Countermaps and Cartographics." "Countermaps" refer to efforts to map "against dominant power structures" and "Cartographics" are reference to the visual manifestations of various spatial mappings. These terms are relevant for us because we will be focusing on ways in which our contributions - albeit still in their early stages - can be framed as mini "resistances." 

This week will be exploring how "countermaps" and "cartographics" can take the form of "map mashups and new spatial media" and how they relate to media art/creative technology. Our discussion will address this question "what is critique?" and the role that media art/creative tech interventions may play in shaping cartographic discourse. The discussion will explore how the changing landscape of tools and participants in mapping and map making have shaped who, how, and what maps operate in the world. 

This week we will focus on web mapping "map mashups." Using the data we collected from last week, we will take a look at programmatic methods for making interactive maps using Leaflet.js. We will also take a look at Kepler.gl, a web-based GUI tool for visualizing spatial data.
