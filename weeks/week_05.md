## ABOUT

The theme this week is "locative media." The discussion will be focused around the ways that mapping can be experienced in physical space. We will examine the geographies of spatial data and the power of "seeing" data in space. Exploring the geography of spatial data means looking at both physical spaces and digital infrastructures.

This week we will focus on ways that artists have attempted to read/write the landscape through a variety of methods. Using the data you have been collecting or analyzing, you will explore ways of creating interventions or provocations in physical space that highlight, visualize, or prompt engagement with your data.
