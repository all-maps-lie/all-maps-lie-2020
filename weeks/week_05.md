# Week 5: Figure-Ground

## SLIDES
* ↳ [Link to Slides]()

## ABOUT

The theme this week is "figure-ground." Figure-ground is often referred to ways we perceive what is in an image as differentiated as the subject and background. This is a fitting frame of reference for ways that we read maps in the form of aerial images and remotely sensed data. 

This week we will focus on "remotely sensed" data in the form of images. Using the data you have been collecting, you will explore imagery from the top-down and the bottom-up, juxtaposing views collected from aerial imagery and those from streetview data services.
