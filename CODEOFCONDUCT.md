# Code of Conduct

# CODE OF CONDUCT 

Hi! We're all here to learn and grow and that means creating and maintaining an environment that is conducive for doing just that. 

### The short version:

* Be a good person! Discrimination and/or intolerance of any shape or form has no place here! 
* We're all for positive vibes and critical perspectives. 
* If you feel it is necessary to report an issue, you can reach out to `Joey`, `Cassie`, or the ITP staff and we will move quickly to address the situation appropriately.

### Additional Pluses

This course is about exploring your self through your data. You'll get the most out of it if you try your hardest to be: 

- Resourceful 
- Self-directed
- Creative
- Curious
- Collaborative
- Empathetic

### A note on personal data and your own politics

Your technological choices matter. Using 3rd party APIs and services means you may be agreeing to terms that could implicate you are the people around you. In this class we will be exploring a number of APIs and services that you may disagree with and/or do not want to use. In any event that you feel uncomfortable with the technologies that are suggested, you do not need to use or expose your data in any way that you disagree with. In this case, please let me - Joey - know and we can work together to find alternatives. The best outcome I can hope for from this class is that we can all have these critical conversations about the the use of technologies and services.


I'm much looking forward to working and learning with you!

### The long version (remixed from Mozilla Community Guidelines)

The following behaviors are expected:

#### Be Respectful

- Value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be kind in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.

#### Be Direct but Professional

- We are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.
Be Inclusive

- Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.

- Be inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:

```
Remote (on video or phone)
Not native language speakers
Coming from a different culture
Using pronouns other than “he” or “she”
Facing other challenges to participate
```

- Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.
Understand Different Perspectives

- Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.

#### Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences

- We all come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect Mozillians to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.

#### Lead by Example

By matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. 

#### Behavior That Will Not Be Tolerated

The following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.

#### Violence and Threats of Violence

- Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) online.
Personal Attacks

- Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.
Derogatory Language

#### Hurtful or harmful language related to:

```
    Background
    Family status
    Gender
    Gender identity or expression
    Marital status
    Sex
    Sexual orientation
    Native language
    Age
    Ability
    Race and/or ethnicity
    National origin
    Socioeconomic status
    Religion
    Geographic location
    Other attributes
```

is not acceptable. This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual’s gender identity. If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.
Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact

- Unwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact is not acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. This includes touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos. This also includes physically blocking or intimidating another person. Physical contact or simulated physical contact (such as emojis like “kiss”) without affirmative consent is not acceptable. This includes sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text.
Disruptive Behavior

- Sustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes:

```
    ‘Talking over’ or ‘heckling’ speakers.
    Drinking alcohol to excess or using recreational drugs to excess, or pushing others to do so.
    Making derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol or other substances, pushing people to drink, talking about their abstinence or preferences to others, or pressuring them to drink - physically or through jeering.
    Otherwise influencing crowd actions that cause hostility in the session.

```

#### Influencing Unacceptable Behavior

- We will treat influencing or leading such activities the same way we treat the activities themselves, and thus the same consequences apply.

#### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Bad behavior from anyone, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Intentional efforts to exclude people (except as part of a consequence of the guidelines or other official action) from the course activities are not acceptable and will be dealt with appropriately.

Reports of harassment/discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly investigated by the people responsible for the safety of the space, event or activity. Appropriate measures will be taken to address the situation.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Violation of these guidelines can result in you being ask to leave the course or the space, either temporarily or for the duration of the class, space or future events and activities in perpetuity.

In addition, any participants who abuse the reporting process will be considered to be in violation of these guidelines and subject to the same consequences. False reporting, especially to retaliate or exclude, will not be accepted or tolerated.

#### Reporting

If you believe you’re experiencing unacceptable behavior that will not be tolerated as outlined above, please contact `Joey` and the designated person at ITP. In addition to conducting any investigation, they can provide a range of resources, from a private consultation to other community resources. They will involve other colleagues, including legal counsel, only as needed to appropriately address each situation.

Please also report to us if you observe a potentially dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of these guidelines, even if the situation is not happening to you.

If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating these guidelines, please follow the same reporting process.

#### Who to Contact
